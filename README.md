# File Sharing App :page_facing_up: â†’ :cloud:

A secure file sharing application using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, Mysql and a REST API. This application allows users to upload, share, and manage files securely.

## Overview

The steps followed to create this application are the following: <br>
Basic Frontend, Database Setup, API, Connections, Refactoring, Polishing Frontend.
Keeping notes here along the way.
For now the files accepted are .pdf, .doc, .jpg, .png.
I was adding columns to the database tables, while building the app.
I used some of my common SCSS practices.
First time building backend, I used GPT, and then studying the answer to understand. Definetely learned a lot on the process.
Struggling with PHP syntax and Database interactions.
Things to do better: One dashboard with limited stuff for users.
